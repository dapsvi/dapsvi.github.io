        <h1>What is a Cardputer?</h1>
        <p>
          The Cardputer is a compact, wallet‐sized computer designed for portability.
          Ideal for on‐the-go tasks, the Cardputer brings modern computing into a small form factor.
          It is based on the ESP-32 board which includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection components natively.
          It can be used as a portable hacking device, essentially replacing most of the flipper zero features for only $USD 30.
          However, to access its full power, you will need to purchase additional equipment to replicate the flipper zero.
